Explore differential gene expression in _Solanum habrochaites_

This is the R code (Shiny App) that allows you to navigate the results of our RNASeq experiment on the differential expression associated with reproductive barriers in a species of nightshade. 
###Run the Shiny App [here](https://hawkmoth.shinyapps.io/habDX/)

Also, [here's a preprint](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/10/13/080663.full.pdf) of the main findings of the experiment.
